The code uses the parseInt() function to convert the user's input (which is initially a string) into an integer. It does this for each of the three numbers that the user is prompted to enter.

The if statement checks whether the three numbers are in numeric order, using the <= operator to compare them. If the numbers are in order, the program prints a message saying so using the console.log() function. If the numbers are not in order, the program prints a different message.

Overall, this program prompts the user to enter three numbers, checks whether they are in numeric order, and prints a message indicating whether they are or not.
